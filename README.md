# ludobots - Assignment 6

# Button
Run search.py to run the evolutions and see the evolved robot. 

Or you can run button.py

Example: 

```python3 search.py```

```python3 button.py ```

## Links
Links are generated by the following code
```python3
 for link in range(0, self.link_count):
            length = random.uniform(.1, 1)
            width = random.uniform(.1, .5)
            height = random.uniform(.1, .5)

            if link == 0:
                z = height / 2

            elif link > 0:
                x = length / 2
                z = 0

            parent = "Body" + str(link)
            child = "Body" + str(link+1)

            if self.sensor_list[link] == 1:
                colorString = "0 1.0 0 1.0"
                colorName = "Green"
            else:
                colorString = "0 0 1.0 1.0"
                colorName = "Blue"

            pyrosim.Send_Cube(name=parent, pos=[x, y, z], size=[
                              length, width, height], colorString=colorString, colorName=colorName)

            if link == 0:
                # absolute position
                print("absolute")
                pyrosim.Send_Joint(name=parent+"_"+child, parent=parent, child=child,
                                   type="revolute", position=[length / 2, 0, height / 2], jointAxis="0 0 1")
            elif link < self.link_count - 1:
                # relative position
                print("relative")
                pyrosim.Send_Joint(name=parent+"_"+child, parent=parent, child=child,
                                   type="revolute", position=[length, 0, 0], jointAxis="0 0 1")

# What I did

Assignment 6:

Created a random number of links with random sizes

Added an array storing my sensor bodies in the constructor

Created a brain that connected selected sensors with all motors

Assigment 5:

I did three things in the assignment.

First, I implemented braniac and connected 4 hidden layers between my sensor neurons (feet and torso) and motor neurons. I created two sets of matrices that I updated everytime in self.mutate().

Second, I built a bipedal robot on top of a raised platform.

Third, I implemented a fitness function that would help the robot learn how to walk forward and balance. My fitness function was torsoX + 3 * torsoZ which is a weighted sum of the distance traveled as well as how upright the torso is - giving extra emphasis to keeping the torso upright so that the robot does not fall over in an attempt to maximize distance travel. I also implemented a penalty that reduced the fitness of each robot by 3 everytime it fell over (torsoZ < 1)
