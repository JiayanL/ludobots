## Robot Structure
This ludobot project expands the morphospace of the 1D creature from assignment 6, allowing it to branch in 3D. Search.py can generate creatures in 1D, 2D, and 3D. Bodies are contiguous, fills in 3D space, and obeys the law of physics.

This is a general diagram of the structure of any robot. Each robot is contained of an initial backbone based on the structure of the snake from assignment 6. Each component of the backbone can then be extended into 1D, 2D, or 3D based on the number of appendages attached to each component of the backbone.

### Body Generation
The backbone of my robot is built with the following code. The accompanying diagram explains its logic. Essentially, the LINK class encapsulates the position and size logic for each part of the backbone. 

**Backbone Construction**

The x, y, and z positions for each piece of the backbone is randomly generated, and the accompanying joint for the next part of the backbone is placed at the edge of the backbone (x/2, 0, z/2).

**Link Class**

This class abstracts a lot of the logic for positioning and arranging each part of the backbone. It stores the parent and child for each block, the size, the position, the joint axis (which can be "0 0 1", "0 1 0", "1 0 0"), the joint type, whether or not each backbone is attached to a limb, and whether or not each part of the backbone has sensors.

**Backbone to Appendage - 1D to 2D**

Each part of the backbone can be attached to an appendage, called a leg to turn it into 3D. Each leg can be attached by any kind of joint (floating, planar, continous, revolute, prismatic, etc.) and be attached to any joint axis. The legs can be attached to the face and is positioned on the side of each block. The logic for leg is encapsulated in the LEG class. The diagram explaining this logic is below.

**Appendage to Foot (3D to 2D)**
Each leg can be extended into 3D by attaching a foot to each appendage. In the Link class, it is determined how many appendages each side of the backbone cube should have. The calculations and diagram is demonstrated as follows. Similar to the appendage, each foot can be attached by any kind of joint (revolute, continuous, planar, prismatic, etc.) and by any joint axis to enable good movement.

#### Joints
Joints are built pretty logically and the logic for each joint is established in specific classes - Link and Leg. The logic for each link is that it takes the full length/width/height along the axis that I want to move it and either move it all the way to the end or halfway.

## Synapses
The code for synapses and brain generation is as follows. Synapses and the brain is generated bottom-up. At each link and leg level, there's a 50% chance whether or not a synapse will be placed at that location. Sensors are placed on those points and connected to motor neurons - which every link in the robot contains.

### Brain Generation
Following is a diagram of how sensors and motors are generated.

Here is a logic connecting sensors (active and inactive to motors)

### Sensor and Motors
Every kind of brain is possible. Sensors are fully connected with motors with the potential for hidden layers. Every sensor can affect every motor.

## Morphospace and Movements
This project can generate 1D, 2D, and 3D structures that can move in all dimensions due to the variability of joint types and joint axes.

## Links and Joints
Links and Joints are generated by the following code. ```self.link_count``` is generated in the constructor and is a random number between 1 and 15. The length, width, and height are randomly generated at each step. The first link is positioned at (0, 0, height/2) with the length, width, and height. Each subsequent link is positioned length/2 away on the x-axis and positioned along the middle of the first link's height. Joints are positioned length away from the previous link with the first link absolutely positioned at the edge of the first link.

Assignment 6:

Created a random number of links with random sizes

Added an array storing my sensor bodies in the constructor

Created a brain that connected selected sensors with all motors

Assigment 5:

I did three things in the assignment.

First, I implemented braniac and connected 4 hidden layers between my sensor neurons (feet and torso) and motor neurons. I created two sets of matrices that I updated everytime in self.mutate().

Second, I built a bipedal robot on top of a raised platform.

Third, I implemented a fitness function that would help the robot learn how to walk forward and balance. My fitness function was torsoX + 3 * torsoZ which is a weighted sum of the distance traveled as well as how upright the torso is - giving extra emphasis to keeping the torso upright so that the robot does not fall over in an attempt to maximize distance travel. I also implemented a penalty that reduced the fitness of each robot by 3 everytime it fell over (torsoZ < 1)
