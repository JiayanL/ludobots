## Links and Joints
Links and Joints are generated by the following code. ```self.link_count``` is generated in the constructor and is a random number between 1 and 15. The length, width, and height are randomly generated at each step. The first link is positioned at (0, 0, height/2) with the length, width, and height. Each subsequent link is positioned length/2 away on the x-axis and positioned along the middle of the first link's height. Joints are positioned length away from the previous link with the first link absolutely positioned at the edge of the first link.

```python3
 for link in range(0, self.link_count):
            length = random.uniform(.1, 1)
            width = random.uniform(.1, .5)
            height = random.uniform(.1, .5)

            if link == 0:
                z = height / 2

            elif link > 0:
                x = length / 2
                z = 0

            parent = "Body" + str(link)
            child = "Body" + str(link+1)

            if self.sensor_list[link] == 1:
                colorString = "0 1.0 0 1.0"
                colorName = "Green"
            else:
                colorString = "0 0 1.0 1.0"
                colorName = "Blue"

            pyrosim.Send_Cube(name=parent, pos=[x, y, z], size=[
                              length, width, height], colorString=colorString, colorName=colorName)

            if link == 0:
                # absolute position
                print("absolute")
                pyrosim.Send_Joint(name=parent+"_"+child, parent=parent, child=child,
                                   type="revolute", position=[length / 2, 0, height / 2], jointAxis="0 0 1")
            elif link < self.link_count - 1:
                # relative position
                print("relative")
                pyrosim.Send_Joint(name=parent+"_"+child, parent=parent, child=child,
                                   type="revolute", position=[length, 0, 0], jointAxis="0 0 1")
```

## Synapses
Synapses are generated by the following code. Based on a randomly generated array of 0s and 1s the same length as self.link_count, we install random links. We then add a motor to every joint and connect every sensor to each motor.
```python3
pyrosim.Start_NeuralNetwork("brain" + str(self.myID) + ".nndf")

        sensor_count = 0
        for link in range(0, self.link_count):
            if self.sensor_list[link] == 1:
                pyrosim.Send_Sensor_Neuron(
                    name=sensor_count, linkName="Body" + str(link))
                sensor_count += 1

        motor_count = 0
        for link in range(0, self.link_count):
            if link < self.link_count - 1:
                pyrosim.Send_Motor_Neuron(
                    name=sensor_count + motor_count, jointName="Body" + str(link) + "_Body" + str(link+1))
                motor_count += 1

        print(sensor_count)
        print(motor_count)

        # connect sensors to motors
        for sensor in range(0, sensor_count):
            for motor in range(0, motor_count):
                pyrosim.Send_Synapse(
                    sourceNeuronName=sensor, targetNeuronName=motor + sensor_count, weight=random.uniform(-1, 1))
```

# What I did

Assignment 6:

Created a random number of links with random sizes

Added an array storing my sensor bodies in the constructor

Created a brain that connected selected sensors with all motors

Assigment 5:

I did three things in the assignment.

First, I implemented braniac and connected 4 hidden layers between my sensor neurons (feet and torso) and motor neurons. I created two sets of matrices that I updated everytime in self.mutate().

Second, I built a bipedal robot on top of a raised platform.

Third, I implemented a fitness function that would help the robot learn how to walk forward and balance. My fitness function was torsoX + 3 * torsoZ which is a weighted sum of the distance traveled as well as how upright the torso is - giving extra emphasis to keeping the torso upright so that the robot does not fall over in an attempt to maximize distance travel. I also implemented a penalty that reduced the fitness of each robot by 3 everytime it fell over (torsoZ < 1)
